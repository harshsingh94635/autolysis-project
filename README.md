# KaroStartup Project 2 – Automated Analysis

This repo contains a single-file solution **`autolysis.py`** that analyzes any CSV, generates 1–3 PNG charts, and writes a narrative **`README.md`** (story format) via an OpenAI-compatible API.

## Quick Start

1. Install **uv** (see: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. Export your AI Proxy token (do NOT commit it):
   ```bash
   export AIPROXY_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   ```
3. Run the script on any CSV:
   ```bash
   uv run autolysis.py /path/to/dataset.csv
   ```

This will generate in the **current working directory**:
- `README.md` – narrative analysis
- `*.png` – up to 3 charts (512×512)

> The script uses retries, compact context, and safe fallbacks if the LLM is not available.

## Repo Structure (as required by the brief)

```
autolysis.py
goodreads/
  README.md + *.png (generated by you)
happiness/
  README.md + *.png (generated by you)
media/
  README.md + *.png (generated by you)
LICENSE
```

> Put each dataset’s outputs in its corresponding folder after you run the script:
> ```bash
> cd goodreads && uv run ../autolysis.py ../goodreads.csv
> cd ../happiness && uv run ../autolysis.py ../happiness.csv
> cd ../media && uv run ../autolysis.py ../media.csv
> ```

## Notes
- Token env var: `AIPROXY_TOKEN`
- Dependencies are defined inline for **uv** to resolve automatically.
- If the LLM is unavailable or token missing, a deterministic README is created.
